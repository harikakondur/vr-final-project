# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade  
## VR Roller Skating Game  
**Harika Kondur**  

### Project Description
My vision for this project is to create an immersive VR roller skating game inspired by *Skate 3* and *Mario Kart*, combining *Skate 3*’s street-style park arenas with the fast-paced, obstacle-dodging excitement of a racing game. Players will race through customizable arenas, dodge obstacles, and collect power-ups. The game will feature customizable avatars, levels, time dilation, and more.
